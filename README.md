## Introduction:

In this research article, I will be talking about progression systems, specifically, what is a progression system and the most common types that we can find and also Why these systems became so popular. I will be also exploring the math behind these structures like progression curves (the behavior of them) and some formulas to create basic progression curves will be also included. And as the maths are not all the developers need to create great progression systems I will include some important game designs concepts which are useful to bear in mind when creating one.

## Progression systems
### What is a progression system? 

A progression system is simply a combination of mechanics which forces the player to make actions with determined goals, and these must complete them in order to move forward. The player will be able to carry out activities during the whole game and along the way, he might be able to unlock new content and new knowledge to learn (new abilities, more quest, etc).

 In order to have a successful progression system, there are some key element to take into account, which are:

* Game Mechanics: 

  great mechanics which makes the player feel satisfaction when interacting with the different elements of your game such as    weapons, abilities, and when doing so, developer have to control and understanding over the learning curve and avoiding to overwhelm the player, in order to do this you could use what is called mechanics progression, which summarising  is a way to   control the way the player learns the different elements of the game over time, there are two types of mechanics progression:
